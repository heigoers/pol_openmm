# CL&Pol force field in xml format for use with OpenMM

These tools follow the same procedure as in [paduagroup/clandpol](https://github.com/paduagroup/clandpol) to create input files for polarizable simulations, so for more detailed information check the instructions there.

**Attention**: please use with a recent version of `fftool` (no older than 02/2024) since there were some changes in the format of the xml files.

## Creating Input Files

1. Use `fftool` and `packmol` as usual, only in the second round give the `-x --type` options:

        fftool 200 ch.xyz 200 Cl.zmat 400 EG.zmat -b 55
        packmol < pack.inp
        fftool 200 ch.xyz 200 Cl.zmat 400 EG.zmat -b 55 -x --type

    This creates `field.xml` and `config.pdb` (and a `config.mmcif` for large systems, see section below)

2. Add Drude particles using the `polxml` script (analogous to the `polarizer` script from [paduagroup/clandpol](https://github.com/paduagroup/clandpol)). Supposing an `alpha.ff` force field file describing the Drude parameters is present, run

        polxml

    This creates files `field-p.xml` and `config-p.pdb` with Drude particles added after each core and the necessary force field terms. These files should run with OpenMM.

3. If necessary scale the LJ potentials, for which the fragment database `fragment.ff` and fragment molecular files are required (in this example the additional `meoh.zmat` for the fragments of ethyleneglycol). A `frag.inp` file specifying which atoms belong to which fragments needs to be prepared. The identification is by atom name:

        # frag.inp for ChCl:EG
        ch N4 C1 C1A COL H1 HC OH
        cl Cl 
        meoh CTO OHG H1O

    Then run

        scaleLJxml

    will generate `field-p-sc.xml`

4. Tun OpenMM using the  `field-p-sc.xml` and `config-p.pdb` as force field and topology. Since Drude particles are already present in `config-p.pdb`, it is not necessary to add Drude particles in the OpenMM script, although it should also be possible to use the initial `config.pdb` and have OpenMM add Drude particles with `modeller.addExtraParticles(forcefield)`.

5. If necessary add Coulomb damping between charges and induced dipoles. This is often required to avoid the polarization catastrophe in systems with strong hydrogen bonds or densely-charged ions. The following script creates OpenMM code implementing the Tang-Toennies damping function:

        coulttxml --xml field-p.xml --pdb config-p.pdb [--core]

The code generated is to be included in the OpenMM script (the atoms involved have to be identified). The `--core` option uses the actual charge of the core site (and the charges on Drude particles) for TT damping. By default the charge on the core will be the opposite off that on the Drude particle, so that TT damping is between a charges and induced dipoles. 

### Input files for large systems (more than 99 999 particles)

PDB files use constrained columns which forbid the numbering of more than 99 999 particles (Drudes included). For larger systems, an option is implemented in the previous tools to use the PDBx/mmcif format. The procedure is almost the same:

1. Use `fftool` and `packmol` as usual with the `-x --type` options:

        fftool 200 ch.xyz 200 Cl.zmat 400 EG.zmat -b 55
        packmol < pack.inp
        fftool 200 ch.xyz 200 Cl.zmat 400 EG.zmat -b 55 -x --type

This creates `field.xml` and `config.mmcif`

2. Add Drude particles using the `polxml` script. It is necessary to specify that the PDBx/mmcif format is used with the options `-ip config.mmcif` giving the name of the input file and `-op config-p.mmcif` giving the one of the output. Supposing an `alpha.ff` force field file describing the Drude parameters is present, run

        polxml -ip config.mmcif -op config-p.mmcif
    
    This creates files `field-p.xml` and `config-p.mmcif` with Drude particles added after each core and the necessary force field terms.

3. If necessary scale the LJ potentials with the same procedure than described above. It will generate `field-p-sc.xml`

4. Tun OpenMM using the `field-p-sc.xml` and `config-p.mmcif` as force field and topology. The OpenMM input script should include something similar to:

        forcefield = app.ForceField('field-p.xml')
        config = app.PDBxFile('config-p.mmcif')

5. If necessary damp at short range charges-dipoles Coulombic interactions with a Tang-Toennis damping function:

        coulttxml --xml field-p.xml --pdb config-p.mmcif [--core]

The code generated is to be included in the OpenMM script (the atoms involved have to be identified). The `--core` option uses the actual charge of the core site (and the charges on Drude particles) for TT damping. By default the charge on the core will be the opposite off that on the Drude particle, so that TT damping is between charges and induced dipoles.

## Some points worth mentioning

### The fragment input file is different from the one for use with LAMMPS

This is unfortunate when using the `scaleLJxml` script. It happens because LAMMPS uses numerical atom type IDs, so the `fragment.inp` input file for scaling LJ parameters in LAMMPS input files has to use atom type numbers. In `xml` input files the atom types are character strings, therefore the two tools are not perfectly compatible in terms of input specification. 


### Unique atom names and types

The `--type` option of `fftool` creates unique atom types (within the entire system), as required by OpenMM to set Drude particle-core pairs. The unique atom `type` is composed from 3 characters from the molecule (`residue`) name, plus the atom name (non-bonded type), plus a serial number. Drude particles will get a preceding `D-`. As a consequence of using the unique atom types, the non-bonded types of the force field are used as the atom `class` (instead of the bonded types), which causes some redundancies in the bonded terms.

Within each `residue` the atom `name` is composed of the chemical element plus a serial number if more than 1 atom of the same element are present. These have to be unique within a `residue` because they are used to specify bonds. This is the CHARMM convention, quite different from the OPLS one that we use mostly. We suppose it is also used by TRAVIS. In order to circumvent the limits of the PDB format (4 characters for the atom name), 32-decimal notation is used for the serial number in very large molecules or materials (which are considered as a single molecule).


### Choice of Drude thermostat (and OpenMM version) 

Although the TGNH thermostat is certainly superior, we couldn't make it work with our `xml` force field files, which run fine in the latest OpenMM versions. There may be bugs or incomplete implementations in OpenMM 7.4.2.

The authors of the TGNH should update it to a more recent version of OpenMM. We think that reverse engineering the force field formats for our systems to run with TGNH in OpenMM 7.4.2 is not worth the effort.

As a result, we would favour using the standard Drude dual thermostats that come with vanilla OpenMM. Maybe these are not the very best but they should be ok for equilibrium quantities (but maybe not ideal for transport properties). Anyway, this is what almost everyone else is using.

Another point is that the Langevin integrators can be considerably faster than NosÃ©-Hoover, also in their Drude versions. The Langevin are stochastic and not reliable for transport properties, but should be ok for equilibrium quantities.


### Temperatures

The Drude integrators in OpenMM don't compute the temperatures of atoms and Drude particles (relative to cores) and show a global temperature that is lower than the set point. The temperatures corresponding to atoms and Drude particles have to be computed separately by the user (as shown in the `omm.py` script).
